After this episode, Instructors will be able to...

* Describe the story they will tell as they guide learners through an HPC Carpentry workshop.
* Describe what the _Amdahl_ executable does.
* Install the _Amdahl_ executable.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints
